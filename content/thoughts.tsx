          For better or worse, many designers are known to judge the work of our
          colleagues and competitors. Our inner monologues are often a stream of
          “I wouldn’t have done that,” “I’ve seen that so many times before,” “I
          could have done it better,” or sometimes just plain old “eww.” I know
          I do it and I’m sure most other hospitality design professionals do
          too. Not to mention, the public does it every day on review sites and
          social media. Whether inside our heads or expressed through keyboards,
          everyone and their cousin’s ferret’s veterinarian’s brother’s
          manicurist has an opinion on hospitality design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week I stayed at a hotel in New York City and found myself with
          an inner dialogue that I believe should be an outer dialogue, because
          I think it’s a topic worthy of a robust discussion. Over my
          three-night stay, most of my thoughts were that the location was
          perfect, and the staff couldn’t have been lovelier. Although the
          design itself isn’t my cup of tea, it was clear that quite a few
          people put quite a bit of thought into the aesthetics. Ironically, the
          obvious amount of thought is what troubled me most and prompted me to
          write this post.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I saw were a number of examples of women being overly sexualized
          throughout the design, from the wallpaper to the art to the
          collateral. One wallpaper featured whimsical sketches of
          skateboarders. In the pattern, the men are skating shirtless with
          pants on, whereas the women are nude. The men are riding the boards
          upright. The women are either naked and bending over backwards, or
          naked and riding three to a board, skin to skin. There’s an art
          element in the lobby that features sculptures of women’s faces with
          lusty expressions, tongues out, and eyes closed while licking
          lollipops. Not one seductive man’s face in sight. Even the luggage
          tags show a man dragging a woman on a rolling suitcase with her legs
          spread around the handle. Are these the things that so many people put
          thought into when developing the property?
        </p>
        <p>
          I began my hospitality design career in 2004 when the aesthetics were
          aggressively driven by sexual themes. Interiors often had slick
          designs with large close-up photos of glossy scarlet female lips,
          black and white photos of a woman’s legs in fishnet stockings and
          six-inch heels, and branding and collateral dripping with innuendo.
          Since then, hospitality trends have mostly moved past those themes.
          The winds thankfully shifted to the analog authenticity of the Ace
          brand, the collected eccentricity of Graduate, and the English
          civility of brands like Soho House, but the one-sided sexiness never
          fully went away. It persists to this day.
        </p>
        <p>That persistence leads me to a list of questions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Who is driving the decision to go in this direction and why do they
            think it’s the right thing to do? Is it the owners, the brands, or
            the designers?
          </li>
          <li>
            Why is it always so one sided? Why aren’t men shown licking
            lollipops or riding chest to back naked on a skateboard?
          </li>
          <li>Why can’t something be sexy without being overt? Is it just a
          lack of design imagination?</li>
          <li>Does math support the idea that sex sells? Does ADR go up
          when men’s libidos go up?</li>
          <li>Do women feel safe objecting to these ideas in professional
          environments during the design and development process? If not, why?</li>
          <li>What message does it put into my thirteen-year-old daughter’s
          head when she stays in a hotel with those elements?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rather than share my thoughts on those queries, I’d love to open the
          comments for a civil, thoughtful, productive, and professional
          discussion. What questions does it raise for you? If you’re for it,
          why? If you’re against, where do you think the solutions lie?

          Friends and colleagues. I think I can speak for all of us when I say
          that the best part of being a hospitality designer and brand developer
          in 2025 is that there are so many massive projects. Ground ups,
          ambitious adaptive reuse ventures, gut job renovations, and myriad
          other marvels of the modern hospitality world. There’s more than
          enough lucrative work to go around for everyone, from owners to
          manufacturers to creatives. Everyone is prosperous. Everyone feels
          safe and happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things are so damn good, banks are giving money out with almost no
          interest rates, and they’re throwing in a free VCR. Owners are buying
          and selling more properties than any time in the history of mankind.
          Glorious transactions are resulting in glorious projects with glorious
          budgets and glorious incomes for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, hospitality manufacturers’ production lines could
          circle the globe fourteen-and-seven-fifths times over because they
          have so many confirmed orders, and they could stretch their bank
          accounts around the world three-hundred-forty-four times because the
          projects have such enormous budgets and all the invoices have been
          paid on time. Global trade has never been easier. Manufacturing costs
          are low, shipping costs are almost nonexistent, free trade has never
          been more fun, and everything arrives earlier than needed or expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the properties are open, the news gets even better. The United
          States has never seen so many international travelers, and domestic
          travelers have almost no budget restrictions on what they’ll pay for a
          room. The world feels stable and safe, allowing consumers to feel
          confident in spending whatever they want on whatever they want while
          traveling wherever they want. Heads in beds slumbering on pillows made
          of money. ADRs higher than Willie Nelson at a Phish show in Amsterdam.
        </p>

          F&B? … “I’ll have the nineteen-pound lobster tail, a side of your
          caviar and gold leaf macaroni salad, some Funyons, and two bottles of
          your 1963 Chateau du Caca de Cochon. Please charge me whatever you
          want. Oh! And give me your risotto with an entire shaved truffle
          that’s the size of the pig who found it. Thanks!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry! Typing the word pig just reminded me that I’m supposed to be
          writing about those grubby chubby mammals. I went rambling on and on
          because I know we’re all sooooo excited about our near utopian
          prosperity. I completely forgot that this is supposed to be a master
          class tutorial on how to do an extreme make over on a pig without
          breaking the piggy bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back on track. Here we go. Let’s say you have a pig and she’s looking
          a bit rough around the edges. Maybe she’s haggard because she lives in
          a petting zoo where she’s constantly harassed by visitors who paw at
          her all day every day. Perhaps she lives an idyllic life on a pastoral
          farm where she’s often covered in mud and slop. She is a pig after
          all. Even the best ones get dirty. Or maybe (probably likely) she’s
          just a grumpy old hog who’s seen better days. Like so many of us,
          she’s just f*c$iNg tired. You can pick for yourself which visual goes
          best with your current emotional state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you have your mental hog, try giving her an appealing name. I
          named mine Apple Butter and I’m going to use her as our guinea pig.
          Let’s walk through the best tips I have for giving Miss Apple Butter
          the glow up she needs and deserves, and remember, the beauty tools you
          use don’t have to be crazy expensive. Smart techniques and an
          experienced hand are far more important than luxury lipsticks.
        </p>
        <p>Without further delay, let’s start painting our puerco:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Assess her existing skin tones, spots, blemishes, and distinctive
            features with an honest and unbiased eye. Chances are her complexion
            is going to be in neutral tones like gray, taupe, beige, and
            whatever the hell greige is. Drab just won’t do for my Miss Piggy,
            and I refuse to recommend it for any of your bacon buddies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, decide which of her features you can live with, which ones you
            can’t, and which ones can be corrected with minor veterinary
            cosmetic surgery. I say minor because it can be expensive AF and I
            just don’t think a pig is something an owner or anyone should spend
            their entire life savings on. Obviously that money is better spent
            investing in a hotel brand staffed completely with felt puppets. (DM
            me for investment opportunities.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The next strategy is to figure out which features can be covered
            with a smart frock, a sparkly accessory, or perhaps a bouffant wig.
            An updo gives your hog a new sense of height and a bright cheerful
            gown is a great way to distract the eye from looking at Apple
            Butter’s unsightly backside. If your pig has a particularly
            challenging rear anatomy, more distraction may be necessary.
            Consider a bold floral or novelty print tailored to suit her
            physique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider changing your pig’s name. Most people don’t know this, but
            Apple Butter is actually a very common name in the porcine world.
            Pigs with that name get teased for being basic if that’s the name
            branded on their butts, and they’re usually the most forgettable
            pigs in the sty. As such, I’ve decided to change Apple’s name to
            Porkwina Floribunda the Magnificent. Please update your notes and
            consider doing the same for your pretty pork chops.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moving on to makeup, before you lay any color, you must spackle her
            blemishes and give her a fresh coat of foundation. Any simple low
            VOC pig paint will do.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, create a makeup palette and style no one is used to seeing.
            Innovation always helps with transformation. Something new always
            draws the guests’ eyes at a petting zoo.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now that you have your foundation and palette, give her a back story
            and a true sense of character. Make her look like Tammy Faye,
            Divine, Tilda Swineton, or perhaps a suburban goth kid who works at
            Hot Topic. It’s the pig owner’s choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, we get to the proverbial “lipstick on the pig.” The number
            one rule of the porcine beauty arts is that you should not and
            cannot do a clear or nude lip. Ever. You can’t just match her skin
            tone and hope for a miracle. No one will notice you’ve done
            anything. Your efforts were futile. Your swine will be forgotten
            without ever being given a chance to swine. Your family will live in
            shame for generations. That’s why you absolutely must give her an
            iconic lip that draws the viewer’s eye and grabs their imagination.
            Your choice of glossy or matte.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In summary, pig makeup can be extremely entertaining and uplifting if
          approached with the right attitude and the belief that all hotels, I
          mean, “pigs” can be beauty queens. The process doesn’t have to be a
          chore you dread, it can be an opportunity you celebrate. Regardless of
          what’s happening in the world, all pigs get old. All pigs get dirty.
          All pigs eventually need a makeover. The best advice I can give a hog
          owner is to hire a professional hotel designer, I mean, “pig stylist”
          with decades of experience and the daring eye to see a swine’s true
          potential. As Farmer Hoggett famously said, “That’ll do Pig. That’ll
          do.”
        </p>
        <p className="note">
          PS – I don’t actually own a pig, but I sure as hell know how to bring
          a hotel back from looking like one. ;-)

        <p>
          When I was three years old, my mom wrote in my baby book “Andy is
          going to be an artist when he grows up.” Since the early days of
          Covid, her observation has been front and center in my brain. Her
          words sparked the question in my head, “What am I, an artist or a
          designer?” When thinking about the latter, I realized there’s a
          certain amount of pressure that comes with the label “designer.” In
          magazines, social media, and business development, my experience has
          been that a designer is expected to manifest an image of a perfect
          life. Beautiful home. Beautiful clothes. Beautiful exotic travel. A
          beautiful flawless façade. I put pressure on myself to live up to that
          trope for nearly two decades, until the forced stillness of Covid gave
          me the opportunity to realize and accept that at I always wanted the
          life of an artist, not a designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does that mean to me? I’m still a hospitality designer and there
          are few things that bring me as much joy as my career, but pivoting to
          the label of artist truly liberated me. I’ve always approached my
          hotel projects as elaborate experiential sculptures that touch the
          hearts and souls of every guest who walks through the doors. Interior
          design is functional art to me, and as such, the title of artist
          supersedes the title of designer. That mental pivot gave me the
          freedom to explore other creative ventures and it relieved the
          internalized pressure of presenting myself as an eccentric
          perfectionist living an interiors magazine life.
        </p>
        <p>
          An artist has zero boundaries or preconceived notions of image, and as
          the band Fischerspooner used to have on their tour tees, “Artists have
          more fun.” Truer words have never been spoken. After liberating myself
          from the designer label, I found my interiors brain grow in expansive
          new ways and my day-to-day life felt freer and more satisfying. I now
          say that I earn my living as a designer, but my soul lives as an
          artist. My love language shifted from facade to freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          When approaching my painting style, I intentionally sought to increase
          my sense of liberation by lowering my chances of self-perceived
          failure. The goal was letting go of control, not creating something
          with the intent of sales or commercial success. The absence of that
          pressure allows me to get into a state of mental flow where my brain
          can wander to new places inspired by the forms developing in front of
          me. Unlike an interiors project where precision is paramount, I was
          able to develop a style where there are almost no ways to make errors.
          Imperfection is a feature, not a flaw. That freedom allows me to get
          into a meditative state where I feel as if inspiration comes from the
          ether. That place of beautiful limbo results in hospitality design
          ideas no one has ever seen, which has always been the cornerstone and
          guiding light of my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making these paintings are an exercise in mindfulness to me, but the
          chaotic abstraction represents a more concrete reality of my life. I’m
          a parent to the most incredible thirteen-year-old daughter who I love
          on a scale that brings both transcendent joy and unfathomable fear.
          Jewel tone neon rainbows and terrifying black holes. I’m sure any
          parent can understand that contrast of emotions. These paintings are
          an exploration of those often-overwhelming feelings and the
          realization that ultimately, we can’t control our children’s
          destinies. Rather than using paint brushes, I use ice and water to
          create the forms. The technique is about accepting that as a parent, I
          can do my best to fill her life with beautiful colors and ideas, but
          ultimately the water is going to flow where it wants to flow, and the
          colors will blend in unpredictable ways. To me, that’s the epitome of
          raising a child. We can do our best to provide them with the best
          ingredients, but ultimately, we can’t control what they make with
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can confidently and unequivocally say that this process of
          acceptance, self-realization, and exploration has helped me grow as a
          designer and reinforced my belief that art heals all. A creative
          healer is the artist, designer, and father I want to be and the
          imaginative being my mom saw from the start.
        </p>
        <p className="note">
          Side note: A couple of paragraphs ago I said that selling art wasn’t
          the primary goal of creating these paintings, but hey, I’m human.
          Contact me me for pricing and availability if your home or project
          needs an antidote for beige.

          We all know the phrase “Opinions are like a*s#oles, everyone has one,”
          but with twenty-plus years of experience in every seat at the
          hospitality design table, my backside has a lot of thoughts to air
          based on first-hand experience. I’m known as the guy who colorfully
          rages against beige mediocrity, but the bedrock of that crusade is a
          foundation of valuable lessons I’m happy to share. My goal is to help
          make all our professional lives easier in a difficult world. As they
          say, rising tides raise all boats.
        </p>
        <p>
          First up, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had frustrated clients
          tell me “We started our project with another designer, but they were
          whining and complaining about budget from the very first meeting. We
          need someone who can work within the realities of our underwriting
          without being a pain in the ass.” In equal measure, I’ve had my ears
          filled with design colleagues complaining about what they aren’t
          allowed to spend, while often painting their clients as Scrooge-like
          misers hoarding coal. The key to a successful project is learning how
          to truly understand each other’s needs and motivations, the core of
          which, not surprisingly, is all about the Benjamins. Better
          understanding will inevitably lead to better results for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004, I started my hospitality career as the capital projects
          manager and style director at Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants. While
          there I learned the importance of bold aesthetics balancing with
          durability and operational efficiency. I’ve played the role of
          entrepreneur for my own design practice, garnering years of experience
          with client relations and learning through the many trials of both
          joyful wins and painful errors, as I climbed the wobbly ladder of
          success. That ladder led me to be the Chief Creative Officer and
          principal designer at Graduate Hotels, where I half joke I got an
          honorary MBA without the student loans. In each position, my primary
          role was to deliver unequaled creative design, but a close second was
          making sure we delivered our ideas within budget to ensure projects
          were profitable for everyone involved. I’ve seen brilliant concepts
          get axed by spreadsheets so brutal they could have been written by
          Freddy Kreuger, and I’ve seen financial models collapse like a house
          of cards because creative choices weren’t aligned with revenue
          drivers. The key is this: vision must align with viability, design
          must support dollars, and everyone on every side of the fence needs to
          take the time to understand the others. That doesn’t make us
          adversaries. It makes us partners with different lenses. We’re all in
          the same play, we just have different roles, and in these times of
          shrinking budgets and unprecedent economic chaos, playing those roles
          cooperatively and to the best of our abilities is more important than
          ever.

          Although I’ve been in hospitality design for two decades, my creative
          philosophies began taking shape when I was barely out of diapers. I
          grew up as a kid with big dreams, but no money, in Akron, OH. My first
          interior project was designing my bedroom in a crayon theme when I was
          four and by the time I was in high school, I wanted that same bedroom
          to look like the first season of “The Real World” on MTV. (Go ahead
          and insert an age joke.) To achieve that design, I had to stretch my
          own non-existent budget with visits to thrift stores, yard sales, and
          scavenging any creative materials I could find. I was even known to
          get dirty doing the occasional dumpster dive. Those constraints were
          inconvenient and difficult, but they weren’t personal attacks on
          myself. Similarly, owners’ budget constraints aren’t personal attacks
          on designers. They are commitments, often tied to investor
          expectations, lender constraints, and underwriting frameworks.
          Designers, you don’t need a finance degree, but you do need to
          understand how money flows through a hotel and builds value for real
          estate. Creativity without financial literacy is a liability. Your
          work life will be easier and your client loyalty higher if you know
          how the sausage is made, or at least what it costs to grind.

          My business partner and hospitality oracle, Bashar Wali , views the
          following areas as the financial fluency you need if you want a seat
          at the grown-up table:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Know the numbers that drive decisions—RevPAR, ADR, EBITDA. These
            aren’t acronyms, they’re the alphabet of value. Do your own
            research, but also don’t be embarrassed or afraid to ask your
            clients what unknown terms mean.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understand Cap Ex – Financial decisions aren’t just for pre-opening.
            The decisions made now will have a long-lasting impact on future
            capital project expenditures like soft good renovations and upgrades
            that may not have been possible in the first round of design. Think
            about day one, but plan for day two.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to speak ROI, not just RGB. - For every design decision made,
            ask the question “Will this help the project get my client an extra
            dollar in room rate?” The key to financially responsible design is
            continuously considering whether a guest will pay more based on the
            aesthetic decisions you’re making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Know where the owner’s money comes from, how it's deployed, and what
            it’s expected to return. – Hotels cost a lot of money to build, and
            that money doesn’t come free. Banks and investors don’t buy into in
            a project with a loose hope that they see returns. Owners and
            lenders sign deals with specific return expectations that must be
            met, often creating the budget restraints that challenge us all.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          His advice for owners? Don’t treat design like icing on the cake. It’s
          not an add-on. It’s a revenue engine. A strong design story and bold
          aesthetic drives rate, fills rooms, sells event space, and builds
          brand loyalty. Pretending it’s a luxury instead of a necessity? That’s
          a strategy for irrelevance. Respecting robust design is an integral
          ingredient of the cake, and as such, it’s vital you share the complete
          financial recipe with your creative team. Doing so isn’t giving away
          trade secrets or putting too many cooks in the kitchen. It’s staffing
          your kitchen with professionally trained chefs.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my own first-hand experience, a working knowledge of hotel
          finance is important, but for a creative partnership to be truly
          successful, understanding needs to happen on both sides. Owners, try
          to walk in your designer’s shoes for a moment. Think about this, one
          number changed in a spreadsheet formula can cause a domino effect that
          throws the rest of the math off. The same can be said of design. A
          designer worth their paycheck spends a lot of time thinking about
          things like balance, flow, and narrative continuity. What may seem
          like a small change to you, can be the unraveling of a sweater to a
          well thought out design and it may add considerable hours of work that
          wasn’t built into their fee. This can sting particularly bad if their
          fee was negotiated down in the beginning of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you, profit and prosperity are a designer’s goal, however
          there is an additional layer to consider when your designer reacts to
          a cut in a passionate or fearful way. When it comes to hotel review
          sites and social media, the designers’ decisions are going to be
          critiqued, often viciously, not yours. Think about this, hospitality
          designers are the ONLY segment of design where every project we create
          is reviewed on the internet in the court of public opinion. Designer
          pushback isn’t always about creative inflexibility or an arbitrary
          desire to spend money like a shopping spree with an Am Ex black card.
          Sometimes we’re saying, “I don’t want those decisions associated with
          my name,” because ultimately, they will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best projects emerge when all sides ask better questions, take
          time to do research, give transparent answers, and respect each
          other’s motivations from the very beginning. Enduring success comes
          when designers understand occupancy dynamics and financial returns,
          owners value creativity and are willing to take the time to truly
          listen to their creative team, and everyone checks their egos with the
          bellman. That’s when we stop building boxes and start creating
          experiences. That’s when we stop managing costs and start building
          blockbusters. That’s when the roles we play create an enduring hit
          filled with singing sausages and dancing wheels of cheddar dressed in
          dazzling shades of moolah green.
        </p>
        <p>
          And last, but certainly not least, f*ck fear and never forget that
          beige is boring.
